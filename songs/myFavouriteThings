My Favourite Things
The Sound Of Music

Rain drops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings...
These are a few of my favorite things.

Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudles,
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings...
These are a few of my favorite things.

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,
Silver white winters that melt into springs...
These are a few of my favorite things.

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad...
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
