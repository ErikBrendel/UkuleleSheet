Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Uh, I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, no
I'll be loungin' on the couch, just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man


Oh Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh


Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90x
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: "This is great"
I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
