Save your Kisses for me
Brotherhood of Man

G h G7 C / c G a aD ://

Though it hurts to go away
It's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you you know
I'll be thinking of You in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on
And I really should be gone
But You keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you all the while
With your cute little way 
Will You promise that you'll save your

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye
Don't cry honey don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
So long honey so long
Hang on baby hang on
Don't You dare me to stay
Cause You know I'll have to say

That I've got to work each day
And that's why I go away
But I count the seconds till I'm home with You
I love you it's true
You're so cute honey, gee
Won't you save them up for me, your
