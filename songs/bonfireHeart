Your mouth is a revolver, firing bullets in the sky
Your love is like a soldier, loyal 'till you die
And I’ve been looking at the stars for a long, long time
I’ve been putting out fires all my life
Everybody wants a flame, they don’t want to get burnt
And today is our turn


Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don’t
Need that much, just some
One that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts


This world is getting colder, strangers passing by
No one offers you a shoulder, no one looks you in the eye
But I’ve been looking at you for a long, long time
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine
Everybody wants a flame, they don’t want to get burnt
Well, today is our turn

[Ref]

Mmmh, our bonfire hearts
Mmmh, our bonfire hearts
Oh, our bonfire hearts
Mmmh, you light the spark
