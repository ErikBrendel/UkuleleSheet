Apologize
One Republic

e G C D ://

I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

They tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that your sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I take another chance,
take a fall, take a shot from you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
It's nothing new

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turnin' blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
