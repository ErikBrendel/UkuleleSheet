She wears an orchid in her long dark hair
Her little smile tells me she knows I care
I love to listen when she plays her song
And she can strum so sweetly all day long

Ukulele girl
You make me smile
Ukulele girl
You drive me wild
Ukulele girl
You rock my my world

I saw her sitting on the beach alone
Playing songs about her Island home
I moved in closer so that I could hear
That ukulele ringing in my ear

[Ref]

I asked her if she'd play a song for me
I knew a song would set my spirit free
Could she be an angel sent from up above
Maybe this is ukulele love
