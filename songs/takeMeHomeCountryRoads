Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, grown' like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain Momma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories, gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

[Ref]

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
