Those were the Days

Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two.
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And thinking of all the great things we would do.

Those were the days, my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance forever and a day;
We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

La la la la la la,
La la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.


Then the busy years went rushing by us,
We lost our starry notions on the way.
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern,
We'd smile at one another and we'd say.

[Ref]

Just tonight I stood before the tavern,
Nothing seemed the way it used to be.
In the glass I saw a strange reflection,
Was that lonely woman really me?

[Ref]

Through the door there came familiar laughter,
I saw your face and heard you call my name.
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser,
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same.

[Ref, Lala again]
