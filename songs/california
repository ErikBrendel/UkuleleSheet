We've been on the run
Driving in the sun
Looking out for number one
California here we come
Right back where we started from

Hustlers grab your guns
Your shadow weighs a ton
Driving down the 101
California here we come
Right back where we started from

California (California)
Here we come!

On the stereo
Listen as we go
Nothing's gonna stop me now
California here we come
Right back where we started from

Pedal to the floor
Thinkin' of the roar
Gotta get us to the show
California here we come
Right back where we started from

California (California)
Here we come!
