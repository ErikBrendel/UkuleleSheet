La Vida Loca

She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
Well, I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got new addictions
For every day and night


She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain


Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca


Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
Took my heart and she took my money
Must've slipped me a sleepin' pill

She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You will never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane!
