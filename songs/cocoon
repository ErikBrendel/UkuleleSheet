Cocoon:
F e a C ://

I know that you must feel like facing with ruin, facing with ruin
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh, so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't know how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened, when I'm weakened

So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you

I've been always playing
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating, overestimated
I made it really hard for you, hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping
