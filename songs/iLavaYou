A long long time ago
There was a volcano
Living all alone in the middle of the sea

He sat high above his bay
Watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone too

And from his lava came
This song of hope that he sang out loud
Every day For years and years

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Years of singing all alone
Turned his lava into stone
Until he was on the brink of extinction

But little did he know
That living in the sea below
Another volcano
Was listening to his song

Everyday she heard his tune
Her lava grew and grew
Because she believed his song was meant for her

Now she was so ready
to meet him above the sea
As he sang his song of hope for the last time

[Ref]

Rising from the sea below
Stood a lovely volcano
Looking all around
But she could not see him

He tried to sing to let her know
That she was not there alone
But with no lava, his song was all gone

He filled the sea with his tears
Watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her


[Ref]

Oh they were so happy
To finally meet above the sea
All together now their lava grew and grew

No longer are they all alone
With Aloha as their new home
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing

I have a dream I hope it will come true
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too
I lava you
