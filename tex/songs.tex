White lips, pale face\\
Breathing in snowflakes\\
Burnt lungs, sour taste\\
Light's gone, day's end\\
Struggling to pay rent\\
Long nights, strange men\\
\\
And they say\\
She's in the Class A Team\\
She's stuck in her daydream\\
Been this way since eighteen\\
But lately her face seems\\
Slowly sinking, wasting\\
Crumbling like pastries and they scream\\
The worst things in life come free to us\\
\\
'Cause she's just under the upper-hand\\
And goes mad for a couple of grams\\
And she don't want to go outside tonight\\
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\
And sells love to another man\\
It's too cold outside\\
For angels to fly\\
Angels to fly\\
\\
Ripped gloves, raincoat\\
Tried to swim and stay afloat\\
Dry house, wet clothes\\
Loose change, bank notes\\
Weary-eyed, dry throat\\
Call girl, no phone

\song{Cocoon}{F e a C :$\mid$$\mid$}{
I know that you must feel like facing with ruin, facing with ruin\\
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing\\
I made you thinking oh, so wrong\\
I made you feeling the worst\\
And I don't know how to get along\\
With myself when I'm weakened, when I'm weakened\\
\\
So let's go back to our cocoon\\
On the blackened afternoon\\
I see your heart is bleeding too\\
Let me bleed instead of you\\
\\
I've been always playing\\
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving\\
So I became a liar, I've been underrating, overestimated\\
I made it really hard for you, hard for you to love me\\
But there's so many things we could do\\
And all we need is escaping, escaping

On a dark desert highway,\\
cool wind in my hair\\
Warm smell of colitas,\\
rising up through the air\\
Up ahead in the distance,\\
I saw a shimmering light\\
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\\
I had to stop for the night.\\
\\
There she stood in the doorway;\\
I heard the mission bell\\
And I was thinking to myself\\
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'\\
Then she lit up a candle\\
and she showed me the way\\
There were voices down the corridor,\\
I thought I heard them say\\
\\
Welcome to the Hotel California\\
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)\\
Such a lovely face.\\
Plenty of room at the Hotel California\\
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here\\
\\
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,\\
she got the Mercedes bends\\
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,\\
that she calls friends\\
How they dance in the courtyard,\\
sweet summer sweat\\
Some dance to remember,\\
some dance to forget\\
\\
So I called up the Captain,\\
'Please bring me my wine'\\
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'\\
And still those voices are calling from\\
far away,\\
Wake you up in the middle of the night\\
Just to hear them say\\
\\
...They livin' it up at the Hotel California\\
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis\\
\\
Mirrors on the ceiling,\\
The pink champagne on ice\\
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'\\
And in the master's chambers,\\
They gathered for the feast\\
They stab it with their steely knives,\\
But they just can't kill the beast\\
\\
Last thing I remember, I was\\
Running for the door\\
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before\\
'Relax' said the night man,\\
'We are programmed to receive.\\
You can check out any time you like,\\
But you can never leave!'

A long long time ago\\
There was a volcano\\
Living all alone in the middle of the sea\\
\\
He sat high above his bay\\
Watching all the couples play\\
And wishing that he had someone too\\
\\
And from his lava came\\
This song of hope that he sang out loud\\
Every day For years and years\\
\\
I have a dream\\
I hope it will come true\\
That you're here with me\\
And I am here with you\\
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above\\
Will send me someone to lava\\
\\
Years of singing all alone\\
Turned his lava into stone\\
Until he was on the brink of extinction\\
\\
But little did he know\\
That living in the sea below\\
Another volcano\\
Was listening to his song\\
\\
Everyday she heard his tune\\
Her lava grew and grew\\
Because she believed his song was meant for her\\
\\
Now she was so ready\\
to meet him above the sea\\
As he sang his song of hope for the last time\\

Rising from the sea below\\
Stood a lovely volcano\\
Looking all around\\
But she could not see him\\

He tried to sing to let her know\\
That she was not there alone\\
But with no lava, his song was all gone\\
\\
He filled the sea with his tears\\
Watched his dreams disappear\\
As she remembered what his song meant to her\\
\\
\\
\emph{\ensuremath{[}Ref\ensuremath{]}}\\

Oh they were so happy\\
To finally meet above the sea\\
All together now their lava grew and grew\\
\\
No longer are they all alone\\
With Aloha as their new home\\
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing\\
\\
I have a dream I hope it will come true\\
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you\\
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too\\

I don't know what\\
I'm to say I'll\\
say it anyway\\
Today's another dayay to find you\\
Shying away\\
I'll be coming for your love, okay?\\
\\
Take on me (take on me)\\
Take me on (take on me)\\
I'll be gone\\
In a day or two\\
\\
So needless to say\\
I'm odds and ends\\
But I'll be\\
stumbling away\\
Slowly learning that life is okay\\
Say after me\\
It's no better to be safe than sorry

\song{Those were the Days}{a a AA7 d $\mid$ d a H E \\~~~~~a d GG7 C $\mid$ d a E a (E) :$\mid$$\mid$}{
Once upon a time there was a tavern\\
Where we used to raise a glass or two.\\
Remember how we laughed away the hours\\
And thinking of all the great things we would do.\\
\\
Those were the days, my friend,\\
We thought they'd never end,\\
We'd sing and dance forever and a day;\\
We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose\\
For we were young and sure to have our way.\\
\\
La la la la la la,\\
La la la la la la,\\
La la la la la la la la la la.\\
\\
\\
Then the busy years went rushing by us,\\
We lost our starry notions on the way.\\
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern,\\
We'd smile at one another and we'd say.\\
\\
\emph{\ensuremath{[}Ref\ensuremath{]}}\\
\\
Just tonight I stood before the tavern,\\
Nothing seemed the way it used to be.\\
In the glass I saw a strange reflection,\\
Was that lonely woman really me?\\
\\
\emph{\ensuremath{[}Ref\ensuremath{]}}\\
\\
Through the door there came familiar laughter,\\
I saw your face and heard you call my name.\\
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser,\\
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same.\\

\song{Through glass}{C D e e :$\mid$$\mid$}{
I'm looking at you through the glass\\
Don't know how much time has passed\\
Oh God, it feels like forever\\
But no one ever tells you that\\
forever feels like home\\
Sitting all alone inside your head\\
\\
How do you feel? That is the question\\
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer\\
When something like a soul becomes initialized\\
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes\\
You can't expect a bit of hope\\
And while you're outside looking in\\
Describing what you see\\
Remember what you're staring at is me\\
\\
How much is real? So much to question\\
An epidemic of the mannequins\\
Contaminating everything\\
When thought came from the heart\\
It never did right from the start\\
Just listen to the noises\\
(No more sad voices)\\
Before you tell yourself\\
It's just a different scene\\
Remember it's just different from what you've seen\\
\\
And it's the stars\\
The stars that shine for you\\
And it's the stars\\
The stars that lie to you
