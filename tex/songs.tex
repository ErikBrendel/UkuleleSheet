White lips, pale face\\
Breathing in snowflakes\\
Burnt lungs, sour taste\\
Light's gone, day's end\\
Struggling to pay rent\\
Long nights, strange men\\
\\
And they say\\
She's in the Class A Team\\
She's stuck in her daydream\\
Been this way since eighteen\\
But lately her face seems\\
Slowly sinking, wasting\\
Crumbling like pastries and they scream\\
The worst things in life come free to us\\
\\
'Cause she's just under the upper-hand\\
And goes mad for a couple of grams\\
And she don't want to go outside tonight\\
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\
And sells love to another man\\
It's too cold outside\\
For angels to fly\\
Angels to fly\\
\\
Ripped gloves, raincoat\\
Tried to swim and stay afloat\\
Dry house, wet clothes\\
Loose change, bank notes\\
Weary-eyed, dry throat\\
Call girl, no phone

I know that you must feel like facing with ruin, facing with ruin\\
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing\\
I made you thinking oh, so wrong\\
I made you feeling the worst\\
And I don't know how to get along\\
With myself when I'm weakened, when I'm weakened\\
\\
So let's go back to our cocoon\\
On the blackened afternoon\\
I see your heart is bleeding too\\
Let me bleed instead of you\\
\\
I've been always playing\\
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving\\
So I became a liar, I've been underrating, overestimated\\
I made it really hard for you, hard for you to love me\\
But there's so many things we could do\\
And all we need is escaping, escaping

Out of the tears, we can't deny\\
We need to swallow all our pride\\
And leave this mess behind\\
Out of my head, out of my bed\\
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad\\
Tell them it's me who made you sad\\
Tell them the fairytale gone bad\\

Another night and I bleed\\
They all make mistakes and so did we\\
We did something we can never turn back right\\
Find a new one to fool\\

Well I've heard there was a secret chord\\
That David played and it pleased the Lord\\
But you don't really care for music, do you?\\
Well it goes like this: The fourth, the fifth\\
The minor fall and the major lift\\
The baffled king composing Hallelujah\\
\\
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof\\
You saw her bathing on the roof\\
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya\\
She tied you to her kitchen chair\\
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair\\
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\\
\\
But baby I've been here before\\
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\\
I used to live alone before I knew ya\\
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch\\
And love is not a victory march\\
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\\
\\
Well there was a time when you let me know\\
What's really going on below\\
But now you never show that to me do ya\\
But remember when I moved in you\\
And the holy dove was moving too\\
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah\\
\\
Maybe there's a God above\\
But all I've ever learned from love\\
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya\\
And it's not a cry that you hear at night\\
It's not somebody who's seen the light\\
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\\
\\
You say I took the name in vain\\
I don't even know the name\\
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?\\
There's a blaze of light in every word\\
It doesn't matter which you heard\\
The holy or the broken Hallelujah\\
\\
I did my best, but it wasn't much\\
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch\\
I've told the truth\\
I didn't come to fool you\\
And even though it all went wrong\\
I'll stand before the Lord of song\\
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

cool wind in my hair\\
Warm smell of colitas,\\

There she stood in the doorway;\\
I heard the mission bell\\
And I was thinking to myself\\
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'\\
Then she lit up a candle\\
and she showed me the way\\
There were voices down the corridor,\\
I thought I heard them say\\

Plenty of room at the Hotel California\\

she got the Mercedes bends\\
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,\\
that she calls friends\\
How they dance in the courtyard,\\
sweet summer sweat\\
Some dance to remember,\\
some dance to forget\\
\\
So I called up the Captain,\\
'Please bring me my wine'\\
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'\\
And still those voices are calling from\\
far away,\\
Wake you up in the middle of the night\\
Just to hear them say\\
\\
...They livin' it up at the Hotel California\\
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis\\
\\
Mirrors on the ceiling,\\
The pink champagne on ice\\
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'\\
And in the master's chambers,\\
They gathered for the feast\\
They stab it with their steely knives,\\
But they just can't kill the beast\\
\\
Last thing I remember, I was\\
Running for the door\\
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before\\
'Relax' said the night man,\\
'We are programmed to receive.\\
You can check out any time you like,\\
But you can never leave!'

This song of hope that he sang out loud\\

Turned his lava into stone\\
Until he was on the brink of extinction\\

Was listening to his song\\

Everyday she heard his tune\\

Save all your kisses for me\\
Bye bye baby bye bye\\
Don't cry honey don't cry\\

That I've got to work each day\\
And that's why I go away\\

In restless dreams I walked alone\\
Narrow streets of cobblestone\\
Beneath the halo of a street lamp\\
I turned my collar to the cold and damp\\
When my eyes were stabbed\\
By the flash of a neon light\\
That split the night\\
And touched the sound of silence\\

And in the naked light I saw\\
Ten thousand people, maybe more\\
People talking without speaking\\
People hearing without listening\\
People writing songs that voices never share\\
And no one dared\\
Disturb the sound of silence\\

Silence like a cancer grows\\
Hear my words that I might teach you\\
Take my arms that I might reach you\\

And echoed\\
In the wells of silence\\

And the people bowed and prayed\\
To the neon god they made\\

She wears an orchid in her long dark hair\\
Her little smile tells me she knows I care\\
I love to listen when she plays her song\\
And she can strum so sweetly all day long\\
\\
Ukulele girl\\
You make me smile\\
Ukulele girl\\
You drive me wild\\
Ukulele girl\\
You rock my my world\\
\\
I saw her sitting on the beach alone\\
Playing songs about her Island home\\
I moved in closer so that I could hear\\
That ukulele ringing in my ear\\
\\
\emph{[Ref]}\\
\\
I asked her if she'd play a song for me\\
I knew a song would set my spirit free\\
Could she be an angel sent from up above\\
Maybe this is ukulele love\\

\song{Viva La Vida}{Coldplay}{F G C a :$\mid\mid$~~~~~F G e a $\mid\mid$}{
I used to rule the world\\
Seas would rise when I gave the word\\
Now in the morning, I sleep alone\\
Sweep the streets I used to own\\
\\
I used to roll the dice\\
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes\\
Listen as the crowd would sing\\
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!\\
\\
One minute I held the key\\
Next the walls were closed on me\\
And I discovered that my castles stand\\
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\\
\\
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing\\
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing\\
Be my mirror, my sword and shield\\
My missionaries in a foreign field\\
For some reason I can't explain\\
Once you go there was never, never a honest word\\
And that was when I ruled the world\\
\\
It was a wicked and wild wind\\
Blew down the doors to let me in\\
Shattered windows and the sound of drums\\
People couldn't believe what I'd become\\
\\
Revolutionaries wait\\
For my head on a silver plate\\
Just a puppet on a lonely string\\
Oh, who would ever want to be king?\\
\\
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing\\
Roman Calvary choirs are singing\\
Be my mirror, my sword and shield\\
My missionaries in a foreign field\\
For some reason I can't explain\\
I know Saint Peter won't call my name\\
Never an honest word\\
But that was when I ruled the world

\song{Wasted Years}{Iron Maiden}{e D e D $\mid$ C e D C $\mid\mid$~~~~~G e D Ca $\mid$ e D C C $\mid\mid$}{
From the coast of gold\\
Across the seven seas\\
I'm traveling on, far and wide\\
But now it seems\\
I'm just a stranger to myself\\
All the things I sometimes do\\
It isn't me but someone else.\\
\\
I close my eyes, and think of home\\
Another city goes by, in the night\\
Ain't it funny how it is\\
You never miss it til it's gone away\\
And my heart is lying there\\
And will be til my dying day.\\
\\
So understand\\
Don't waste your time always\\
Searching for those wasted years\\
Face up, make your stand\\
And realize you're\\
living in your golden years.\\
\\
Too much time on my hands\\
I got you on my mind\\
Can't ease this pain, so easily\\
When you can't find the words to say\\
It's hard to make it through another day\\
And it makes me wanna cry\\
And throw my hands up to the sky.\\

\song{Wonderful World}{Louis Armstrong}{C e a e $\mid$ d C E a $\mid$ F F d G $\mid$ C G :$\mid\mid$}{
I see trees of green, red roses too\\
I see them bloom for me and you\\
And I think to myself what a wonderful world\\
\\
I see skies of blue and clouds of white\\
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night\\
And I think to myself what a wonderful world\\
\\
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow\\
They'll learn much more than I'll never know\\
And I think to myself what a wonderful world\\
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world

Today is gonna be the day\\
That they're gonna throw it back to you\\
By now you should've somehow\\
Realized what you gotta do\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
Feels the way I do, about you now\\
\\
Backbeat, the word was on the street\\
That the fire in your heart is out\\
I'm sure you've heard it all before\\
But you never really had a doubt\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
Feels the way I do about you now\\
\\
And all the roads we have to walk are winding\\
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding\\
There are many things that I\\
Would like to say to you but I don't know how\\
\\
Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me\\
And after all, you're my wonderwall\\
\\
Today was gonna be the day\\
But they'll never throw it back to you\\
By now you should've somehow\\
Realized what you're not to do\\
I don't believe that anybody\\
Feels the way I do, about you now\\
\\
And all the roads that lead you there are winding\\
And all the lights that light the way are blinding\\
There are many things that I\\
Would like to say to you but I don't know how\\

\song{Zombie}{Cranberries}{a F C G :$\mid\mid$}{
Another head hangs lowly\\
Child is slowly taken\\
And the violence caused such silence\\
Who are we mistaken?\\
\\
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family\\
In your head, in your head they are fighting\\
With their tanks and their bombs\\
And their bombs and their guns\\
In your head, in your head, they are crying\\
\\
In your head, in your head\\
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie\\
What's in your head, in your head\\
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh\\
\\
Du du du duh \emph{[x4]}\\
\\
Another mother's breakin'\\
Heart is taking over\\
When the violence 'causes silence\\
We must be mistaken\\
\\
It's the same old theme since 1916\\
In your head, in your head they're still fighting\\
With their tanks and their bombs\\
And their bombs and their guns\\
In your head, in your head they are dying\\
