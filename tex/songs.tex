\song{Cocoon}{F e a C ://}{
I know that you must feel like facing with ruin, facing with ruin
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh, so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't know how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened, when I'm weakened

So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you

I've been always playing
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating, overestimated
I made it really hard for you, hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping

He said "Son
Have you seen the world?
Well what would you say
If I said that you could?
Just carry this gun
You'll even get paid"
I said, "That sounds pretty good"

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair
But it looks alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

[Ref]

She walked
Through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away

And the shells
jumped trough the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed
with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

There's a moment in time
And it's stuck in my mind
Way back, when we were just kids
Cause your eyes told the tale
Of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did

Oh, waves of time
Seem to wash away
The scenes of our crimes
But for you this never ends

Can you stay strong?
Can you go on?
Kristy are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom
Winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Though the marks on your dress
Had been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I should have spoke out
And I'm so sorry now
I didn't know
Cause we were so young

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on
Innocence left behind
And it never goes away

F F C C / E E a G ://

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from here
I hope they didn’t get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You’ve never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn’t talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense is controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
