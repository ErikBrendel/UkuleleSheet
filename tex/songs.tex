\song{Cocoon}{F e a C :$\mid$$\mid$}{
I know that you must feel like facing with ruin, facing with ruin\\
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing\\
I made you thinking oh, so wrong\\
I made you feeling the worst\\
And I don't know how to get along\\
With myself when I'm weakened, when I'm weakened\\
\\
So let's go back to our cocoon\\
On the blackened afternoon\\
I see your heart is bleeding too\\
Let me bleed instead of you\\
\\
I've been always playing\\
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving\\
So I became a liar, I've been underrating, overestimated\\
I made it really hard for you, hard for you to love me\\
But there's so many things we could do\\
And all we need is escaping, escaping

Und wenn mal wieder ein Atomkraftwerk brennt\\

La?t mich endlich mit eurem Gen?le in Ruh'\\
wenn ich Lust dazu hab, schei? ich die Nordsee zu\\
Danach zieh ich mir ein Robbensteak rein\\
auf einem Teller aus Elfenbein\\

Und dann leg ich die Ladies von Greenpeace flach\\
eine nach der anderen, die ganze Nacht:\\
und ich lach!

I want to live\\

He said "Son\\
Have you seen the world?\\
Well what would you say\\
If I said that you could?\\
Just carry this gun\\
You'll even get paid"\\
I said, "That sounds pretty good"\\

Black leather boots\\
Spit-shined so bright\\
They cut off my hair\\
But it looks alright\\
We marched and we sang\\
We all became friends\\
As we learned how to fight\\
\\
A hero of war\\
Yeah, that's what I'll be\\
And when I come home\\
They'll be damn proud of me\\
I'll carry this flag\\
To the grave if I must\\
Cause it's a flag that I love\\
And a flag that I trust\\
\\
I kicked in the door\\
I yelled my commands\\
The children, they cried\\
But I got my man\\
We took him away\\
A bag over his face\\
From his family and his friends\\
\\
They took off his clothes\\
They pissed in his hands\\
I told them to stop\\
But then I joined in\\
We beat him with guns\\
And batons not just once\\
But again and again\\

She walked\\
Through bullets and haze\\
I asked her to stop\\
I begged her to stay\\
But she pressed on\\
So I lifted my gun\\
And I fired away\\
\\
And the shells\\
jumped trough the smoke\\
And into the sand\\
That the blood now had soaked\\
She collapsed\\
with a flag in her hand\\
A flag white as snow\\
\\
A hero of war\\
Is that what they see?\\
Just medals and scars\\
So damn proud of me\\
And I brought home that flag\\
Now it gathers dust\\
But it's a flag that I love\\
It's the only flag I trust

\song{Hotel California}{a E G D $\mid$ F C d E :$\mid$$\mid$\\~~~~~F C d a $\mid$ F C d E :$\mid$$\mid$}{
On a dark desert highway,\\
cool wind in my hair\\
Warm smell of colitas,\\
rising up through the air\\
Up ahead in the distance,\\
I saw a shimmering light\\
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\\
I had to stop for the night.\\
\\
There she stood in the doorway;\\
I heard the mission bell\\
And I was thinking to myself\\
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'\\
Then she lit up a candle\\
and she showed me the way\\
There were voices down the corridor,\\
I thought I heard them say\\
\\
Welcome to the Hotel California\\
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)\\
Such a lovely face.\\
Plenty of room at the Hotel California\\
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here\\
\\
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,\\
she got the Mercedes bends\\
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,\\
that she calls friends\\
How they dance in the courtyard,\\
sweet summer sweat\\
Some dance to remember,\\
some dance to forget\\
\\
So I called up the Captain,\\
'Please bring me my wine'\\
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'\\
And still those voices are calling from\\
far away,\\
Wake you up in the middle of the night\\
Just to hear them say\\
\\
...They livin' it up at the Hotel California\\
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis\\
\\
Mirrors on the ceiling,\\
The pink champagne on ice\\
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'\\
And in the master's chambers,\\
They gathered for the feast\\
They stab it with their steely knives,\\
But they just can't kill the beast\\
\\
Last thing I remember, I was\\
Running for the door\\
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before\\
'Relax' said the night man,\\
'We are programmed to receive.\\
You can check out any time you like,\\
But you can never leave!'

\song{I lava you}{C G7 F CG7 :$\mid$$\mid$\\~~~~~F C G7 C $\mid$ F C FG7 C $\mid$$\mid$}{
A long long time ago\\
There was a volcano\\
Living all alone in the middle of the sea\\
\\
He sat high above his bay\\
Watching all the couples play\\
And wishing that he had someone too\\
\\
And from his lava came\\
This song of hope that he sang out loud\\
Every day For years and years\\
\\
I have a dream\\
I hope it will come true\\
That you're here with me\\
And I am here with you\\
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above\\
Will send me someone to lava\\
\\
Years of singing all alone\\
Turned his lava into stone\\
Until he was on the brink of extinction\\
\\
But little did he know\\
That living in the sea below\\
Another volcano\\
Was listening to his song\\
\\
Everyday she heard his tune\\
Her lava grew and grew\\
Because she believed his song was meant for her\\
\\
Now she was so ready\\
to meet him above the sea\\
As he sang his song of hope for the last time\\
\\
\emph{\ensuremath{[}Ref\ensuremath{]}}\\
\\
Rising from the sea below\\
Stood a lovely volcano\\
Looking all around\\
But she could not see him\\
\\
He tried to sing to let her know\\
That she was not there alone\\
But with no lava, his song was all gone\\
\\
He filled the sea with his tears\\
Watched his dreams disappear\\
As she remembered what his song meant to her\\
\\
\\
\emph{\ensuremath{[}Ref\ensuremath{]}}\\
\\
Oh they were so happy\\
To finally meet above the sea\\
All together now their lava grew and grew\\
\\
No longer are they all alone\\
With Aloha as their new home\\
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing\\
\\
I have a dream I hope it will come true\\
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you\\
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too\\
I lava you

Vor zwei Wochen hab ich dich zum ersten mal gesehen\\
Du warst so betrunken, du konntest kaum noch stehen\\
Aus Mitleid, hab ich dich nach Haus gebracht\\
Du sagtest zärtlich "Mein Schatz, Gute Nacht!"\\
Mein Schatz hast du gesagt\\
Vielleicht war es nur ein Scherz?!\\
Amors Pfeil durchbohrte mein Herz\\
Jetzt weiß ich nicht, was ich denken soll...\\
Ist es wirklich liebe oder find ich dich nur toll\\
\\
Ich weiß nicht ob es liebe ist\\
Wenn man tagelang nichts trinkt und isst\\
Wenn man an eine denkt, und eine andere küsst\\
Ich weiß nicht ob das liebe ist...\\
\\
Am nächsten Tag, habe ich dich besucht\\
Als das Bier alle war, hast du laut geflucht\\
Du lagst auf dem Bett und warst ziemlich breit\\
Aber immerhin waren wir allein zu zweit\\
Ich wollte mit dir reden über deine Frisur\\
Und über Liebe, aber du lachtest nur!\\
Jetzt weiß ich nicht, was ich denken soll...\\
Ist es wirklich liebe oder find ich dich nur toll\\
\\
Ich weiß nicht ob es liebe ist\\
Wenn man alle Frauen an einee misst\\
Wenn man etwas hört und es sofort vergisst\\
Ich weiß nicht ob das liebe ist...\\
\\
... Wenn man beim pinkeln ständig nebens Becken pisst...

Seem to wash away\\
The scenes of our crimes\\
But for you this never ends\\

Can you stay strong?\\
Can you go on?\\
Kristy are you doing okay?\\
A rose that won't bloom\\
Winter's kept you\\
Don't waste your whole life trying\\
To get back what was taken away\\

Though the marks on your dress\\
Had been neatly repressed\\
I knew that something was wrong\\
And I should have spoke out\\
And I'm so sorry now\\
I didn't know\\
Cause we were so young\\

Oh, clouds of time\\
Seem to rain on\\
Innocence left behind\\
And it never goes away

The first time ever she saw him\\
Carried away by a moonlight shadow\\
He passed on worried and warning\\
Carried away by a moonlight shadow\\
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night\\
Far away on the other side\\
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight\\
And she couldn't find how to push through\\
\\
The trees that whisper in the evening\\
Carried away by a moonlight shadow\\
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving\\
Carried away by a moonlight shadow\\
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun\\
Far away on the other side\\
He was shot six times by a man on the run\\
And she couldn't find how to push through\\
\\
Four a.m. in the morning\\
Carried away by a moonlight shadow\\
I watched your vision forming\\
Carried away by a moonlight shadow\\
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night\\
Far away on the other side\\
Will you come to terms with me this night\\
But she couldn't find how to push through

I'm looking at you through the glass\\
Don't know how much time has passed\\

But no one ever tells you that\\
forever feels like home\\
Sitting all alone inside your head\\

How do you feel? That is the question\\
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer\\
When something like a soul becomes initialized\\
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes\\
You can't expect a bit of hope\\
And while you're outside looking in\\
Describing what you see\\
Remember what you're staring at is me\\
\\
How much is real? So much to question\\
An epidemic of the mannequins\\
Contaminating everything\\
When thought came from the heart\\
It never did right from the start\\
Just listen to the noises\\
(No more sad voices)\\
Before you tell yourself\\
It's just a different scene\\
Remember it's just different from what you've seen\\
\\
And it's the stars\\
The stars that shine for you\\
And it's the stars\\
The stars that lie to you
